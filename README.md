# Navigating_Adolescence_website


This project aims to develop an interactive virtual reality exhibition tour website on a teenager-hood journey. The website will provide information and resources on how to deal with stress during adolescence. It will also use virtual reality technology to create an immersive and engaging experience for teenagers.

The project is motivated by the lack of access to proper assistance and support for teenagers during adolescence. It is also motivated by the potential of virtual reality technology to address mental stress conditions and provide immersive and safe environments for teenagers.

The project will have the following objectives:

To develop an exhibition tour website offering information and resources with articles, expertise advice and videos on how to deal with stress during adolescence.
To provide statistical data analysis and communicate the outcomes through pie charts, bar charts and tables to facilitate clear visualization by administrators.
The project will focus on teenagers as the target users. It will use a variety of sources, such as personal stories and research data, to provide a unique perspective on the experiences of teenagers.
